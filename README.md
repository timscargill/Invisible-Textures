# Invisible Textures

This repository accompanies the paper '[_Invisible Textures: Comparing Machine and Human Perception of Environment Texture for AR_](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372985913_Invisible_Textures_Comparing_Machine_and_Human_Perception_of_Environment_Texture_for_AR#fullTextFileContent)', to appear at ACM Immercom '23. In this paper we compare the effect of environment texture on machine perception for augmented reality (AR), i.e., visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI-SLAM), with human perception of texture, to inform the design of environments which support good device tracking performance yet have minimal impact on user perception of virtual content. 

We perform extensive experiments on the effect of texture on VI-SLAM performance using our previously published game engine-based emulator, **Virtual-Inertial SLAM**. For more information on this tool, implementation code and instructions, and examples of the types of projects it can support, please visit the [Virtual-Inertial SLAM GitHub repository](https://github.com/timscargill/Virtual-Inertial-SLAM/).
